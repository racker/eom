Incubator project for general OpenStack API middleware.

So far, includes verb-based ACL enforcement and simple/efficient rate limiting.
Ideas and code should be contributed upstream to OpenStack, according to community interest.


NOTE
----

This project was originally developed by Rackspace. However, as the Rackspace repository is not longer public
or modifiable by the maintainers is has been moved to one of the downstream forks.
