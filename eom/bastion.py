"""bastion: A WSGI middleware that serves as a simple gate keeper.

Its primary function is to provide a way to bypass certain layers of
the middleware wrapping onion, particularly for the purpose of
allowing special access to /health -type endpoints for a load balancer
(LB).

Here, skipping layers is referred to as "using the backdoor" and the
standard entry point for the app is referred to as "gated entry".

Wrapping with the bastion looks like:

    backdoor = marconi.queues.transport.wsgi.app.app
    gated = UriTransformer.wrap(Authentication.wrap(backdoor))
    app = bastion.wrap(backdoor, gated)

The control flow is as follows:

1. If the route being accessed is present in the restricted list, use
   the backdoor. However, if X-Forwarded-For is present, return 404.
2. Otherwise, proceed through the gate.

The configuration is given as a comma-separated list of paths, e.g.:

    [eom:bastion]
    restricted_routes = /v1/health, /v1/stats

Routes may also be separated by newlines, e.g.:

    restricted_routes =
        /v1/health
        /v1/stats
